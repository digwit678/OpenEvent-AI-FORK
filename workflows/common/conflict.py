---

Room conflict detection and resolution for the booking workflow.

Two conflict scenarios:

SCENARIO A: Option + Option (Soft Conflict)
- Client 2 selects room already Option for Client 1
- Both become Option
- Client 2 receives soft warning
- NO HIL task (yet)
- Manager sees both on calendar

SCENARIO B: Option + Confirm (Hard Conflict)
- Client 2 tries to CONFIRM when Client 1 has Option
- HIL task created automatically
- Manager must decide who gets the room
- Loser redirected to Step 2 or 3

Implements first-come-first-served with manager override.
