## Findings
- ✅ HIL gate before offer prep: TURN4 approval unlocks Step 5 offer drafting.
- ✅ Confirmation HIL before close: TURN12 confirms Step 7 after transition_ready.
- ✅ Detours reset correctly: Requirements change raised caller_step and returned via return_to_caller.
- ✅ Thread state transitions: Thread toggles between 'Awaiting Client Response' and 'In Progress' only.
- ✅ Audit trail coverage: Each step change logged, including return_to_caller on detour return.
- ✅ Confirmation variant triggered: Negotiation accept + confirmation handoff executed.

## Suggested follow-ups
- All checks passed.
