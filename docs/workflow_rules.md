# Workflow Rule Log

## Global
- 2025-11-10: Every shortcut and general Q&A turn must annotate debugger subloops (`shortcut`, `general_q_a`) so trace colors match the conversation path.

## Step 2 – Date Confirmation
- 2025-11-10: Vague month/weekday requests clear any prefilled date, reset the event to Step 2, and require the client to pick a concrete date before Step 3 can run.
- 2025-11-10: Hybrid “dates + menus/products” questions stay in Step 2 via the general-room Q&A flow; we answer with date options, compact product summaries, and halt until the client confirms a date.

## Step 3 – Room Availability
- 2025-11-10: Room ranking highlights matched vs. missing requirements (derived from intake preferences/notes) and uses those badges in both the debugger table and client draft.
