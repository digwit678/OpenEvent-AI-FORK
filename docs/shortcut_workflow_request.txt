Subject: Team Strategy Workshop – Availability in December?

Body:
Hello,
We’re planning a full-day strategy workshop for our Zurich office team in December. Ideally sometime during the second week (maybe around December 10 or 11).
We expect around 22 participants and would like a U-shape seating layout with a projector and coffee service.
Could you please let us know if you have an available room for that week and what the options are?
Best regards,
