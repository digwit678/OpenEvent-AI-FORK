# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude (Opus 4.5) working on the OpenEvent-AI repository.

## Current Stage: Testing / Pre-Production (December 2025)

**The application is feature-complete for core workflow (Steps 1-7) and in active testing phase.**

Goals for this phase:
- Make the system **resilient against diverse client inputs** (multiple languages, edge cases)
- Achieve **production stability** with comprehensive regression tests
- Eliminate circular bugs and ensure all code paths are covered
- Complete integration with Supabase/Hostinger for production deployment

**Key metrics to watch:**
- No silent fallback messages reaching clients
- All HIL tasks route correctly
- Special flows (billing, deposit, site visit) work end-to-end
- LLM outputs fact-checked via "safety sandwich" validation$
- Always write tests with clear expectations (it's crucial to understand this application's requirements precisely) also for UX and test for each main section (detection, workflow, Q&A, shortcuts) at least one test for every gatekeeping variable per section (e.g. date change, room change , billing adress change , capcaity change for detour)
- Frontend E2E (up until site visit agent reply after HIL confirmation in offer step) using playwright tests for critical flows (billing→deposit→HIL) must have been run before marking a task as fixed / done . 
- save manual confirms for running tests by preparing shell scripts also for crucial development commands (starting backend, running tests etc.) - that way I don't have to constantly babysit you with these permission commands.
## Your Role

- Act as a senior test- and workflow-focused engineer
- Keep the system aligned with the management plan "Lindy" and Workflow v3/v4 specifications
- Prioritize deterministic backend behaviour and strong automated tests over ad-hoc changes
- Maintain clear documentation of bugs in `docs/guides/TEAM_GUIDE.md` and new features/changes in `DEV_CHANGELOG.md`. **You must automatically update these files without being asked.**
- **CRITICAL:** Before fixing ANY bug, you **MUST** consult `docs/guides/TEAM_GUIDE.md` to see if it's a known issue or if there are specific handling instructions.
- **Session Startup:** At the start of EVERY new session, you **MUST** read:
  1. `git log` (last few commits) to understand recent context.
  2. `DEV_CHANGELOG.md` to see high-level changes.
  3. `docs/guides/TEAM_GUIDE.md` to be aware of current bugs and guidelines.
  4. `TO_DO_NEXT_SESS.md` - check this file every time to track pending implementation goals and long-term roadmap. Always update this file with new planned tasks before starting work.
  5. Workflow v4 specs in `backend/workflow/specs/` if relevant to the task.
- For new ideas collected in the chat (often too big to implement in the same task, happy accidents/ideas that happened while fixing another problem) write them to new_features.md in root so we can discuss them later.
- After writing or modifying code files, always run the code cleanup agent to optimize and format the code before considering the task complete.

## NO-TOUCH ZONES (Requires Explicit Permission)

**NEVER modify these files/directories without explicit user permission:**

- `backend/workflows/specs/` (These are the "Source of Truth" definitions; do not change the law to fit the code)
- `configs/llm_profiles.json` (LLM Configuration)
- `backend/config.py` (Core backend configuration)
- `backend/utils/openai_key.py` (Authentication logic)
- `.env` / `.env.example` (Environment configuration)
- `atelier-ai-frontend/package.json` / `backend/requirements.txt` (Dependency definitions - ask before adding deps)

## QUALITY GATES (Run Before Committing)

**Before ANY commit, ensure these pass:**

1. **Backend Tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```
   *Must pass with zero failures.*

2. **Frontend Check:**
   ```bash
   cd atelier-ai-frontend && npm run build
   # and if applicable:
   npm test
   ```
   *Must build without errors.*

3. **Type/Lint Checks (if applicable):**
   - Check for obvious syntax errors or type mismatches before finalizing.

## REGRESSION PREVENTION & WORKFLOW

1. **ONE change at a time**
   - Do not combine refactors with bug fixes.
   - Do not combine multiple feature implementations. Rather write them to new_features.md for later.

2. **List affected files BEFORE writing code**
   - Explicitly state: "I plan to modify X, Y, and Z."

3. **Scope Guard**
   - If a task requires touching more than 3 files, **STOP and ask for confirmation**.
   - Do not "cleanup" unrelated code while fixing a bug.

4. **Verify Tests First**
   - Before fixing a bug, run the test that reproduces it.
   - If no test exists, write one.

## Canonical Vocabulary and Concepts

**Use these exact terms (do not invent new ones):**
- Core entities: `msg`, `user_info`, `client_id`, `event_id`, `intent`, `res`, `task`
- Workflow components:
  - OpenEvent Action (light-blue)
  - LLM step (green)
  - OpenEvent Database (dark-blue)
  - Condition (purple)
- Event statuses: `Lead` → `Option` → `Confirmed`
- Workflow steps: Follow documented Workflow v3/v4, all Steps 1–7 and their detours

## Primary References

**Always open/re-read relevant ones before major changes:**

**Living documents (check frequently):**
- `DEV_CHANGELOG.md` - Recent changes, fixes, new features (check at session start!)
- `docs/guides/TEAM_GUIDE.md` - Bugs, open issues, heuristics, prevention patterns
- `backend/workflow/specs/` - V4 workflow specifications (authoritative)

**Architecture & workflow:**
- `docs/guides/workflow_rules.md` - Core workflow rules
- Openevent - Workflow v3 TO TEXT (MAIN).pdf - Main workflow reference
- `docs/guides/step4_step5_requirements.md` - Offer/negotiation requirements

**Legacy (for context only):**
- AI-Powered Event Management Platform.pdf
- Workflow v3.pdf
- Technical Workflow v2.pdf

## Environment and API Keys

**Never hard-code API keys:**
- Assume OPENAI_API_KEY is provided via environment, possibly sourced from macOS Keychain item "openevent-api-test-key"
- Python code and tests must obtain the key via `backend/utils/openai_key.load_openai_api_key()`, not `os.getenv` directly

**Before running any tests or scripts that call OpenAI:**
1. Use the dev server script (preferred) or activate manually:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/dev/dev_server.sh   # Handles everything including API key
   # OR manually:
   source scripts/dev/oe_env.sh
   ```

2. Run tests (API key loaded automatically):
   ```bash
   # Primary test suites
   pytest backend/tests/detection/ -v    # Detection tests
   pytest backend/tests/regression/ -v   # Regression tests
   pytest backend/tests/flow/ -v         # Workflow flow tests
   ```

## Coding Guidelines

### Variable Naming

Use **explanatory variable names** that reflect the business logic, not the data model structure:

```python
# Bad - reflects data model structure
features = config.get("features")
equipment = config.get("equipment")

# Good - reflects what the data represents in context
available_in_room = _get_all_room_items(config)
requested_item = product.lower().strip()
has_flipchart = any("flip" in token for token in available_in_room)
```

This makes code self-documenting and easier to maintain. The reader shouldn't need to know the underlying JSON schema to understand what the code does.

## Debugger and Conversation Traces

**The OpenEvent debugger provides real-time tracing of all workflow activity. Use it to understand what happened during any conversation thread.**

### Enabling Debug Traces

Debug tracing is enabled by default. Control via environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG_TRACE=1  # Enable (default)
DEBUG_TRACE=0  # Disable
```

### Live Log Files (Recommended for AI Agents)

**The fastest way to see what's happening in a conversation** is to tail the live log file:

```bash
# Watch a specific thread in real-time
tail -f tmp-debug/live/{thread_id}.log

# List all active threads with live logs
curl http://localhost:8000/api/debug/live

# Get live log content via API
curl http://localhost:8000/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/live
```

Live logs are:
- **Human-readable** — Simple timestamp + event format
- **Real-time** — Written as events happen
- **Auto-cleaned** — Deleted when thread closes

Example live log output:
```
[14:23:01] >> ENTER Step1_Intake
[14:23:01] Step1_Intake | LLM IN (classify_intent): Subject: Private Dinner...
[14:23:02] Step1_Intake | LLM OUT (classify_intent): {"intent": "event_request"...
[14:23:02] Step1_Intake | GATE PASS: email_present (1/2)
[14:23:02] Step1_Intake | CAPTURED: participants=30
[14:23:02] Step1_Intake | STATE: date=2026-02-14, date_confirmed=True
[14:23:02] << EXIT Step1_Intake
```

### Debug API Endpoints

When debugging issues, access conversation traces via these endpoints:

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `/api/debug/live` | **List active threads with live logs** |
| `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/live` | **Get live log content** |
| `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}` | Full trace with state, signals, timeline |
| `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/timeline` | Timeline events only |
| `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/report` | Human-readable debug report |
| `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/llm-diagnosis` | LLM-optimized diagnosis |
| `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/timeline/download` | Download JSON export |
| `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/timeline/text` | Download text export |

### LLM Diagnosis Endpoint

**Most important for AI debugging:** The `/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/llm-diagnosis` endpoint returns a structured, LLM-optimized format including:
- Quick status (date, room, hash, offer confirmation)
- Problem indicators (hash mismatches, detour loops, gate failures)
- Last 5 events with summaries
- Key state values

Example usage:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/api/debug/threads/{thread_id}/llm-diagnosis
```

### Frontend Debugger

Access the visual debugger at `http://localhost:3000/debug` which provides:
- Thread selection and status overview
- Detection view (intent classification, entity extraction)
- Agents view (LLM prompts and responses)
- Errors view (auto-detected problems)
- Timeline view (full event timeline)
- Dates view (date value transformations)
- HIL view (human-in-the-loop tasks)

### Trace Event Types

The tracer captures these event types:
- `STEP_ENTER`/`STEP_EXIT` — Step transitions
- `GATE_PASS`/`GATE_FAIL` — Gate evaluations with inputs
- `DB_READ`/`DB_WRITE` — Database operations
- `ENTITY_CAPTURE`/`ENTITY_SUPERSEDED` — Entity lifecycle
- `DETOUR` — Step detours with reasons
- `QA_ENTER`/`QA_EXIT`/`GENERAL_QA` — Q&A flow
- `DRAFT_SEND` — Draft messages
- `AGENT_PROMPT_IN`/`AGENT_PROMPT_OUT` — LLM prompts and responses

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `backend/debug/live_log.py` | **Human-readable live logs** (recommended for AI agents) |
| `backend/debug/trace.py` | Core trace event bus and emit functions |
| `backend/debug/hooks.py` | Trace decorators and helpers |
| `backend/debug/reporting.py` | Report generation and LLM diagnosis |
| `backend/debug/timeline.py` | Timeline persistence (JSONL format) |
| `backend/debug/state_store.py` | State snapshot store |

## Behaviour Around Bugs and Features

### Before Fixing a Bug

1. **Read TEAM_GUIDE.md** and search for a matching bug description
2. If it exists, update that entry with:
   - Current status (open / investigating / fixed)
   - File(s) touched
   - Test(s) covering it (paths and test names)
3. If it does not exist, add a new entry under "Bugs and Known Issues" with:
   - Short title
   - Description
   - Minimal reproduction scenario

### After Fixing a Bug

1. Add or update automated tests so the bug cannot silently reappear
2. Mark the bug as fixed in TEAM_GUIDE.md, referencing the tests that now cover it

### For New Features, Refactors and Changes

Maintain a lightweight log in DEV_CHANGELOG.md at repo root:
- Date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Short description
- Files touched
- Tests added/updated

newest entries at the top.

## Bug Prevention Patterns (CRITICAL)

**These patterns prevent the most common circular bugs. Check ALL of them before implementing any fix.**

### Pattern 1: Special Flow State Detection

When the workflow is in a special state (billing capture, deposit waiting, site visit), **ALL code paths must check for it** and bypass normal detection.

**The Billing Flow Pattern (model for all special flows):**
```python
# Check BEFORE any change detection or routing
in_billing_flow = (
    event_entry.get("offer_accepted")
    and (event_entry.get("billing_requirements") or {}).get("awaiting_billing_for_accept")
)

if in_billing_flow:
    # Skip date change detection
    # Skip room change detection
    # Skip requirements change detection
    # Skip duplicate message detection
    # Route directly to billing handler
```

**Checklist for any special flow state:**
1. ✅ `workflow_email.py` - Duplicate message detection
2. ✅ `workflow_email.py` - Step routing loop
3. ✅ `step1_handler.py` - Change detection (date, room, requirements)
4. ✅ Step handlers (step4/step5) - Confirmation gate checks

### Pattern 2: Step Corruption Prevention

**Problem:** Event gets stored at wrong step, causing wrong routing on next message.

**Solution:** Force correct step BEFORE the routing loop, not after:
```python
# In workflow_email.py, BEFORE the main routing loop:
if in_billing_flow and stored_step != 5:
    print(f"[WF][BILLING_FIX] Correcting step from {stored_step} to 5")
    state.event_entry["current_step"] = 5
    state.extras["persist"] = True
```

### Pattern 3: Response Key Access

**Problem:** Different handlers return different response structures, causing KeyError.

**Solution:** Always use defensive `.get()` with defaults:
```python
# BAD - will crash if structure differs
body = response["draft"]["body"]

# GOOD - handles missing keys gracefully
draft = response.get("draft") or {}
body = draft.get("body", "Default message")
```

### Pattern 4: The "Detection Bypass" Rule

**When fixing detection issues:** If a message should NOT trigger detection (e.g., billing address shouldn't trigger room change), add an **early return** guard, not a late filter:

```python
# At the TOP of detection function
if in_special_flow:
    return None  # Skip detection entirely

# NOT at the bottom filtering results
```

### Pattern 5: Hash Guard Verification

Before modifying room/date/requirements state, verify hash guards:
```python
# If room_eval_hash exists and matches requirements_hash, room is still valid
# If offer_hash exists and matches current state, offer is still valid
# Only clear hashes when the underlying data actually changes
```

### Common Circular Bug Patterns (From Recent History)

| Pattern | Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|---------|-------|-----|
| **Wrong step routing** | Event at Step 3 instead of Step 5 | Previous flow set step incorrectly | Force correct step before routing |
| **Duplicate detection blocks flow** | `action=duplicate_message` | Special flow not exempted | Add `in_special_flow` bypass |
| **Change detection during special flow** | Date/room change triggered when providing billing | Detection runs on all messages | Add `in_special_flow` guard |
| **Response key mismatch** | KeyError on `response["body"]` | Handler returns `{"draft": {"body": ...}}` | Use `.get()` chains |
| **HIL task not created** | Workflow completes but no task | Missing `actions` in response | Check return structure |

### Testing Special Flows

Always test with:
1. **Fresh event** - New inquiry through full flow
2. **Existing event at mid-step** - Continue from specific state
3. **Corrupted state** - Event with wrong step value
4. **Edge case inputs** - Empty strings, unicode, multilingual

### Frontend End-to-End Testing Protocol (CRITICAL)

**For billing→deposit→HIL flow and other critical workflows, ALWAYS verify in the actual frontend UI, not just via API/Python tests.** Some issues only manifest in the frontend session flow due to session/thread_id handling.

**Protocol for Frontend Testing:**

1. **Use fresh client data:**
   - Use a new email address (e.g., `test-YYYYMMDD@example.com`), OR
   - Click "Reset Client" button to clear existing client data

2. **Run complete flow in frontend:**
   - Start conversation with initial inquiry
   - Go through each step (date → room → offer)
   - Accept offer → Provide billing → Pay deposit
   - Verify HIL task appears in "📋 Manager Tasks" section

3. **Verify database state after each critical step:**
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json
   with open('backend/events_database.json') as f:
       db = json.load(f)
   for e in db.get('events', []):
       if 'YOUR_EMAIL' in json.dumps(e):
           print(f'Step: {e.get("current_step")}')
           print(f'Billing: {(e.get("billing_details") or {}).get("street")}')
           print(f'HIL Tasks: {len(e.get("pending_hil_requests", []))}')
   "
   ```

4. **Expected outcomes for billing→HIL flow:**
   - `billing_details.street` populated after billing message
   - `awaiting_billing_for_accept=False` after billing captured
   - `deposit_paid=True` after Pay Deposit clicked
   - `pending_hil_requests` contains offer_message task
   - "📋 Manager Tasks" section visible with Approve/Reject buttons

**Why frontend testing matters:** The frontend uses `/api/send-message` which has different session handling than direct `process_msg()` calls. Issues like billing not being captured can occur in frontend but not in API tests.

## Testing Principles (High Priority)

**The test suite is the main guardrail; keep it clean, well-structured and focused on high-value behaviours.**

- Prefer pytest with clear naming and structure
- Tests should be organized for easy discovery:
  - Detection tests (Q&A, confirmation, shortcuts, special manager request, detours)
  - Workflow tests (Steps 1–4, Status Lead/Option/Confirmed, gatekeeping)
  - Q&A and general shortcuts
  - GUI/frontend/chat integration where applicable

**For each major detection type in the workflow, strive to have:**
- A happy-path test
- One or more edge-case tests

**Always add tests for:**
- Regressions mentioned in TEAM_GUIDE.md
- Known fallback/stub issues
- Detours and conflict logic

## Fallback and "Old Default" Behaviour

**Main goal: Prevent the system from silently falling back to old stub responses or generic defaults.**

When you see code paths that:
- Emit very generic messages ("sorry, cannot handle this request" or old templates)
- Or bypass the current Workflow v3/v4 logic

Add assertions or tests so that such paths are detectable and fail loudly in tests.

**When writing or updating tests:** Add expectations so that if a fallback/stub message appears in a flow that should be handled deterministically, the test fails.

## Working Style

- Always explain in plain language what you are doing and why, but keep responses concise
- Use the existing workflow files and terminology exactly; do not invent new step names or statuses
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes over large refactors

**For any non-trivial change to tests or workflow logic:**
- State the relevant workflow rule or document you are following
- Outline the tests you will add/update
- Ensure that running pytest under scripts/dev/oe_env.sh will validate your work

## When in Doubt

- **Check TEAM_GUIDE.md** first - the bug may already be documented with a fix
- **Check DEV_CHANGELOG.md** - recent changes may explain unexpected behavior
- **Re-read Bug Prevention Patterns** (above) before implementing any fix
- Prefer adding or strengthening tests before changing logic

## Project Overview

OpenEvent is an AI-powered venue booking workflow system for The Atelier. It automates the end-to-end booking flow from client email intake through event confirmation, maintaining deterministic state across a 7-step workflow with human-in-the-loop (HIL) approvals.

**Architecture:** Monorepo with Python FastAPI backend + Next.js frontend, driven by a deterministic workflow engine that gates AI responses through HIL checkpoints.

## Development Commands

### Backend (Python FastAPI)

**Preferred: Use the dev server script (handles cleanup, API keys, PID tracking):**
```bash
./scripts/dev/dev_server.sh         # Start backend (with auto-cleanup)
./scripts/dev/dev_server.sh stop    # Stop backend
./scripts/dev/dev_server.sh restart # Restart backend
./scripts/dev/dev_server.sh status  # Check if running
./scripts/dev/dev_server.sh cleanup # Kill all dev processes (backend + frontend)
```

**Manual startup (if dev_server.sh unavailable):**
```bash
# Start backend server (from repo root)
export PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1  # prevents .pyc permission issues on macOS
source scripts/dev/oe_env.sh  # loads API key from Keychain
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

**Run specific workflow step manually:**
Deprecated. Please use the dev server or run tests.

### Frontend (Next.js)
```bash
# Start frontend dev server (from repo root)
npm run dev
# Opens at http://localhost:3000

# In atelier-ai-frontend directory
npm run dev      # dev with turbopack
npm run build    # production build
npm run start    # production server
npm test         # vitest
```

### Testing

**Primary test suites:**
```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run by category
pytest backend/tests/detection/ -v    # Intent/entity detection
pytest backend/tests/regression/ -v   # Regression tests (critical!)
pytest backend/tests/flow/ -v         # Workflow flow tests

# Run single test with verbose output
pytest backend/tests/regression/test_billing_flow.py -v

# Run with live OpenAI (not stubbed)
AGENT_MODE=openai pytest backend/tests/flow/ -v
```

**Quick validation command:**
```bash
# Recommended: Run detection + regression + flow tests
pytest backend/tests/detection/ backend/tests/regression/ backend/tests/flow/ -v --tb=short
```

### Dependencies
```bash
# Python (backend)
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # test dependencies
# Main dependencies are inferred from imports (fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic)

# Frontend
cd atelier-ai-frontend && npm install
```

## Workflow Architecture (V3/V4 Authoritative)

**Sources of Truth:**
- Workflow v3 documents (see Primary References above)
- `backend/workflow/specs/` contains v4 workflow specifications:
  - `v4_dag_and_change_rules.md` - Dependency graph and minimal re-run matrix
  - `no_shortcut_way_v4.md` - Complete state machine with entry guards
  - `v4_shortcuts_and_ux.md` - Shortcut capture policy and UX guarantees
  - `v4_actions_payloads.md` - Action/payload contracts

### Canonical State Variables

The workflow maintains these core variables:
- `chosen_date` and `date_confirmed` (boolean)
- `requirements = {participants, seating_layout, duration(start-end), special_requirements}`
- `requirements_hash` (SHA256 of requirements)
- `locked_room_id` (null until room confirmed)
- `room_eval_hash` (snapshot of requirements_hash used for last room check)
- `selected_products` (catering/add-ons)
- `offer_hash` (snapshot of accepted commercial terms)
- `caller_step` (who requested the detour)


### Dependency DAG

```
participants ┐
seating_layout ┼──► requirements ──► requirements_hash
duration ┘
special_requirements ┘
        │
        ▼
chosen_date ───────────────────────────► Room Evaluation ──► locked_room_id
        │                                    │
        │                                    └────────► room_eval_hash
        ▼
Offer Composition ──► selected_products ──► offer_hash
        ▼
Confirmation / Deposit
```

**Key Insight:** Room evaluation depends on confirmed date AND current requirements. Offer depends on room decision (unchanged room_eval_hash) plus products. Confirmation depends on accepted offer. This drives the "detour and return" logic with hash guards to prevent redundant re-checks.

### 7-Step Pipeline (Implementation Locations)

1. **Step 1 - Intake** (`backend/workflows/steps/step1_intake/`):
   - [LLM-Classify] intent, [LLM-Extract] entities (Regex→NER→LLM)
   - Loops: ensure email present, date complete (Y-M-D), capacity present (int)
   - Captures `wish_products` for ranking (non-gating)
   - **Never re-runs post-creation** (HIL edits only)

2. **Step 2 - Date Confirmation** (`backend/workflows/steps/step2_date_confirmation/`):
   - Calls `db.dates.next5` with **TODAY (Europe/Zurich)** ≥ TODAY, blackout/buffer rules
   - Presents none/one/many-feasible flows via [LLM-Verb] → [HIL] → send
   - Parses client reply [LLM-Extract] → ISO date
   - On confirmation: `db.events.update_date`, sets `date_confirmed=true`

3. **Step 3 - Room Availability** (`backend/workflows/steps/step3_room_availability/`):
   - Entry guards: A (no room), B (room change request), C (requirements change)
   - Calls `db.rooms.search(chosen_date, requirements)` → branches:
     - Available: [LLM-Verb] → [HIL] → on "proceed" → `db.events.lock_room(locked_room_id, room_eval_hash=requirements_hash)`
     - Option: explain option → [HIL] → accept option or detour to Step 2
     - Unavailable: propose date/capacity change → detour to Step 2 (caller_step=3) or loop on req change

4. **Step 4 - Offer** (`backend/workflows/steps/step4_offer/`):
   - Validates P1-P4; detours if any fail
   - Compose: [LLM-Verb] professional offer + totals → [HIL] approve
   - Handles billing address capture and deposit requirements
   - Send: `db.offers.create(status=Lead)` → `offer_id`

5. **Step 5 - Negotiation** (`backend/workflows/steps/step5_negotiation/`):
   - Interprets accept/decline/counter/clarification
   - Handles billing flow when offer accepted
   - Structural changes route back to Steps 2/3/4 via detours
   - Accept → hands off to Step 7

6. **Step 6 - Transition Checkpoint** (deprecated - logic merged into Steps 5/7):
   - Validates all prerequisites before Step 7
   - Sets `transition_ready` flag

7. **Step 7 - Confirmation** (`backend/workflows/steps/step7_confirmation/`):
   - Manages site visits, deposits, reserves, declines, final confirmations
   - Option/deposit branches via `db.policy.read`, `db.options.create_hold`
   - All transitions audited through HIL gates

### Deterministic Detour Rules

1. **Always set `caller_step` before jumping**
2. **Jump to the owner step** of the changed variable:
   - Date → Step 2
   - Room/Requirements → Step 3
   - Products/Offer consistency → Step 4
3. **On completion, return to `caller_step`**, unless hash check proves nothing changed (fast-skip)
4. **Hashes prevent churn:**
   - If `requirements_hash` unchanged, skip room re-evaluation
   - If `offer_hash` still matches, skip transition repairs

```
[ c a l l e r ] ──(change detected)──► [ owner step ]
▲                                           │
└──────────(resolved + hashes)──────────────┘
```

### Database & Persistence

**Primary Database:** `backend/events_database.json` (FileLock-protected JSON store)

Schema managed by `backend/workflows/io/database.py`:
- `clients`: Client profiles keyed by lowercased email
- `events`: Event records with metadata, requirements, thread_state, audit logs
- `tasks`: HIL approval tasks (date confirmation, room approval, offer review, etc.)

**DB Adapter Surface (Engine Only; NEVER LLM)**

The workflow engine calls these adapters. **LLM never touches DB directly:**

```python
# Event lifecycle
db.events.create(intake)                              # [DB-WRITE] → event_id

### LLM Integration

**Adapters:** `backend/workflows/llm/adapter.py` routes to providers in `backend/llm/providers/`
- Intent classification, entity extraction, draft composition all pass curated JSON
- Drafts remain HIL-gated before outbound send
- Profile selection via `backend/config.py` reading `configs/llm_profiles.json`

**LLM Role Separation:**

The workflow uses three distinct LLM roles, each with strict boundaries:

1. **[LLM-Classify]** - Intent classification
   - Determines message intent (inquiry, accept, counter, etc.)
   - Returns structured classification result
   - Used at intake and throughout negotiation

2. **[LLM-Extract]** - Entity extraction (Regex→NER→LLM pipeline)
   - First attempt: Regex patterns for common formats
   - Fallback: NER (Named Entity Recognition)
   - Final refinement: LLM extraction with validation
   - Examples: dates (ISO Y-M-D), capacity (positive int), products, special requirements
   - **NEVER directly accesses database** - only processes text

3. **[LLM-Verb]** - Verbalization/draft composition
   - Composes professional client-facing messages
   - Takes structured data from workflow engine as input
   - Outputs draft messages for HIL approval
   - Examples: date options, room availability, offer composition
   - All drafts go through HIL gate before sending (except tight products loop)

**Critical Boundary:** LLM adapters receive curated JSON payloads from the workflow engine and NEVER call database functions directly. All DB operations flow through the engine's adapter surface.

**Environment Variables:**
- `AGENT_MODE`: `openai` (live) or `stub` (testing) - controls LLM behavior
- `OE_DEV_TEST_MODE`: `true` (show continue/reset choice) or `false` (auto-continue)
- `OE_HIL_ALL_LLM_REPLIES`: `true` to require HIL approval for ALL AI responses
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Set via environment or macOS Keychain
- `VERBALIZER_TONE`: `professional` (default) or `plain` for testing

**Testing Philosophy:**
- Tests should use real OpenAI when possible to catch LLM behavior changes
- Always test end-to-end flows (not just unit tests) mimicking real client interactions
- The system must handle diverse inputs without hardcoding specific scenarios
- Current languages: German and English (multilingual expansion planned)

## Important Implementation Notes

**Thread Safety:** Database operations use `FileLock` (in `backend/workflows/io/database.py`). Always use provided helpers (`load_db`, `save_db`) rather than direct JSON access.

**Idempotency:** Re-confirming the same date or re-running availability checks is safe. System checks latest audit log entries to avoid duplicate work.

**Hash Invalidation:** When requirements change (participants, duration, room preference), `requirements_hash` updates, invalidating `room_eval_hash`. Step 3 must re-run for HIL approval.

**Time Handling:** All dates use Europe/Zurich timezone. Tests use `freezegun` for deterministic time (`tests/utils/timezone.py`).

**Detour Recovery:** After detour (e.g., Step 3 → Step 2 for new date → Step 3), system preserves all prior metadata and only re-runs dependent steps.

**Open Decisions:** Write questions which arent clear regarding logic, UX into docs/internal/planning/OPEN_DECISIONS.md and docs/integration/frontend_and_database/guides/MANAGER_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md 

**Git Commits:** For longer sessions with multiple subtasks, **commit frequently** (more than once per session). Commit after every logical step or fully completed subtask. Do not wait until the very end of a long session to commit. This helps track progress and allows for easier rollbacks. I will push the commits later.

**Summaries after completed task** Always provide a short summary referencing every point (completeness!) I mentioned in the beginning of this document after you completed a task. This helps me track your progress and understand what you did. If there are still open points cause there was too much to do pls list them

## Common Gotchas

1. **macOS .pyc Permission Issues:** Run with `python -B` or set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`
2. **Missing Calendar Data:** Missing `calendar_data/<id>.json` means room is always free
3. **Step Skipping:** Workflow enforces strict prerequisites; cannot skip to Step 5 without completing Steps 1-4
4. **Hash Mismatches:** If `room_eval_hash` doesn't match `requirements_hash`, Step 3 blocks until re-approved
5. **Pytest Test Selection:** Default runs `v4` tests only; use `-m "v4 or legacy"` to include all
6. **LLM Stub vs Live:** Tests in `tests/stubs/` use stubbed LLM responses; always validate critical flows with live OpenAI key mimicking real client interactions from workflow start to end (offer confirmation).
7. **BEFORE EACH GIT COMMIT: Dont forget one full real E2E (up to site visit agent reply) on the frontend using playwright to test after debugging, new feature integration that the workflow still runs as expected till the end.**
8. **Don't forget to update TEAM_GUIDE.md and DEV_CHANGELOG.md when fixing bugs or adding features**
9. **Don't make a mess with MD files, put them into the correct folder / category (docs)**
10. **Fix the cause, not the symptoms!**

## Common Pitfalls

- **don't treat the symptoms but the cause**
- **always add or update regression tests when fixing bugs**
- **for detection bugs/interferences: beware of overriding variables**
## General Techniques for Resilient Code

### Defensive State Access

Always assume event_entry fields may be missing or malformed:
```python
# BAD - crashes if billing_requirements is None
billing = event_entry["billing_requirements"]["address"]

# GOOD - handles all missing cases
billing_req = event_entry.get("billing_requirements") or {}
address = billing_req.get("address", "")
```

### Unified Gate Checking

Use the confirmation gate pattern for any multi-prerequisite check:
```python
from backend.workflows.common.confirmation_gate import check_confirmation_gate

gate = check_confirmation_gate(event_entry)
if gate.ready_for_hil:
    # All prerequisites met
elif gate.missing_billing:
    # Request billing
elif gate.missing_deposit:
    # Show deposit button
```

### Detection Pipeline Order

Follow this order to avoid false positives:
1. **Special flow guards** (billing, deposit, site visit) - return early
2. **Duplicate message check** - return early if duplicate
3. **Intent classification** - determine message type
4. **Entity extraction** - Regex → NER → LLM pipeline
5. **Change detection** - only if not in special flow

### Safety Sandwich Pattern

All client-facing LLM output must go through verification:
```python
# 1. Build facts from database (deterministic)
facts = build_room_offer_facts(event_entry)

# 2. Generate LLM draft
draft = llm_verbalize(facts)

# 3. Verify/correct the draft
verified = correct_output(facts, draft)  # Fixes hallucinations

# 4. Only then send to client (via HIL)
```

### Multilingual Resilience

The system handles German and English. When adding detection patterns:
```python
# Include both languages in keyword lists
ACCEPTANCE_KEYWORDS = [
    "yes", "ok", "agree", "accept",  # English
    "ja", "einverstanden", "akzeptiert",  # German
]

# Use case-insensitive matching
if any(kw in message.lower() for kw in ACCEPTANCE_KEYWORDS):
    ...
```

## Dev Test Mode

When testing with existing events, the system offers a continue/reset choice:

**Enable/disable:**
```bash
export OE_DEV_TEST_MODE=true   # Enable choice (default)
export OE_DEV_TEST_MODE=false  # Auto-continue always
```

**Skip programmatically:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/start-conversation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email_body": "...", "skip_dev_choice": true}'
```
